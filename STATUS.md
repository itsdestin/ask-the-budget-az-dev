# Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-05-20

This file is the single source of truth for what's shipped, what's
open, and what's blocked. The phase plans under `docs/superpowers/`
remain as the historical record of design intent — but those plans
have NOT been updated as features shipped, so use this file (not the
plans) to understand current state.

`CLAUDE.md` auto-imports this file via `@STATUS.md`, so every Claude
Code session sees the latest contents in context. **Do not duplicate
status info into CLAUDE.md** — every duplication is a future drift
source. When something ships, update only this file.

## What's shipped (Phase 1c)

### Retrieval sidecar (`retrieval/api.py`)
- FastAPI service on `127.0.0.1:9200`
- `POST /retrieve` — BM25 + dense + RRF + Voyage rerank. Accepts optional `intent: "lookup" | "compare" | "analyze"` (resolves to default top_k 5 / 12 / 18 when no explicit top_k passed) and echoes intent in the response. Default `top_k` when no intent + no explicit value is 15 (was 20 through 2026-05-19; lowered after dogfood showed spillover at top_k=20).
- `POST /cite/validate` — chunk_id existence + quote-in-chunk-text + span sanity (negative / inverted / oversized). **The content-word-overlap alignment check was DROPPED 2026-05-20** — it was a string-overlap heuristic that produced ~40% false rejections on faithful-but-differently-worded claim_spans. Real faithfulness validation will come from WS3 (NLI verifier, unbuilt).
- `POST /cite/validate_batch` — validates N citations in one round-trip with bulk DB fetch (one `WHERE chunk_id = ANY(%s)` query for all unique chunks). Powers the MCP `cite_batch` tool.
- `POST /list_values` — returns canonical_id slugs with chunk counts + sample doc titles
- `GET /docs/{doc_id}` — document metadata for the PDF viewer
- Sidecar startup loads `.env.local` via python-dotenv; lifespan preflight validates `VOYAGE_API_KEY` + `DATABASE_URL` + chunks-table-non-empty before accepting requests, exiting with a clear stderr message on any failure.
- **55 pytest passing**

### Citation `cite()` / `cite_batch()` behavior
- `cite()` accepts either explicit `span_start`/`span_end` offsets OR a `quote: string` field (server scans chunk.text for the quote and derives the offsets). Quote is the preferred path; offsets are legacy. `claim_span.max` is 2000 chars on the schema; server soft-clamps to 500 with `truncated: true` flag.
- `cite_batch({citations: [...]})` is the multi-citation companion: collapses N serial round-trips into one. The model's tool_use carries an array of single-cite shapes; the response is a parallel array of single-cite results. System prompt steers toward `cite_batch` whenever an answer has more than one citation.
- Both tools return `resolved_span_start` / `resolved_span_end` on success — the sidecar-derived position of the cited text inside chunk.text. The web UI uses these for precise PDF text-layer highlighting.
- The locked schema decision doc (`docs/superpowers/decisions/2026-05-06-citation-tool-schema.md`) has a 2026-05-20 amendment header documenting all of the above.

### MCP server (`mcp-server/`)
- Four tools registered: `retrieve`, `cite`, `cite_batch`, `list_filter_values`
- Per-conversation `.mcp.json` materialization with `alwaysLoad: true` on the budget MCP server (eliminates ToolSearch round-trips for the budget tools). Per-conversation `.claude/settings.json` allow/deny — allow: Bash, Read, the four budget MCP tools; deny: Grep, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, Glob, PowerShell, WebFetch, WebSearch, ToolSearch, plus glob denies for unrelated MCP servers (`windows-control`, `gmessages`, `imessages`, `todoist`, `spotify-services`).
- `retrieve()` first-call cap: the FIRST retrieve() of any session is capped to 5 chunks regardless of input top_k/intent. Response carries `first_call_capped: true`. Bypassable with `deep_dive: true` for explicit thorough-coverage requests. Subsequent retrieves are uncapped.
- System prompt (~1300 lines) covers: constrained-agent contract, "tools are preloaded — do NOT call ToolSearch" notice, **progressive retrieval pattern** (first call samples, model expands if needed), **Route-the-question-first classifier** (lookup/compare/analyze → answer FORMAT, not retrieve breadth), **Output hygiene** (banned leak categories: internal vocabulary, corpus mechanics, retry narration), cite() quote recipe, filter dimensions + agency cheat sheet, doc lifecycle (Governor → Baseline → Approps → AFR), 3-year table structure, AFR accuracy hierarchy, retrieval recipes, refusal cases.
- Structured per-call JSONL logging at `~/.claude/ask-the-budget-az/bridge.log` (timestamp, endpoint, duration, outcome, httpStatus, errorCategory, retrievalId). One line per /retrieve and /cite/validate(_batch) call.
- **57 vitest passing**

### Web app (`web/`)
- Next.js multi-turn chat UI on `127.0.0.1:3000`
- Citation rendering:
  - Inline-underlined chips for successful cites; red-X wavy-underline for failed
  - Retry chips collapse via two-pass dedup: (1) chunk_id + substring-chain union-find; (2) FIFO-pair fail→ok across blocks for the same chunk_id (handles claim_span-rewritten retries). Suppresses pairing within a single `cite_batch` (same `batchId`) — sibling claims in a batch are intentional distinct citations, not retries.
  - Tooltip shows verbatim quote (success) or claim-vs-actual-cited side-by-side (failure)
  - MCP zod errors humanized (not raw JSON)
  - Markdown table-row claims inject sentinel inside the last cell
  - Citation `spanStart`/`spanEnd` resolution order: ack's `resolved_span_start/end` (preferred) → explicit input offsets (legacy) → `(0, claim_span.length)` sentinel (only for in-flight or pre-fix calls; produces "couldn't pinpoint" badges in the PDF viewer).
- Tool cards: friendly labels (Search corpus, Cite claim, Cite claims, Browse filters, Shell, …) with per-tool body views (RetrieveView, CiteView, ListFilterValuesView, EditView, ShellView, …). Single status indicator on the header (pixel-glyph color encodes running/complete/failed); pulses while running.
- PDF viewer (`web/components/PdfPage.tsx`):
  - pdfjs-dist canvas render with bbox-restricted text-layer search
  - Multi-pass match strategy: chunk.text\[span_start:span_end\] → full chunk.text → individual currency tokens; bbox-restricted first, then unrestricted
  - "Couldn't pinpoint" badge instead of misleading chunk-bbox fallback when all matches fail
  - "Couldn't open source PDF" error when chunk's source isn't a PDF (DOCX legislative bills currently — DOCX viewer is Phase 2)
- ChatThread auto-scroll: event-driven detection, only follows bottom when the user is at bottom. Messages anchor to the BOTTOM of the viewport.
- UI refresh + JLBC mascot (shipped 2026-05-19, branch `ui-prettify-mascot`):
  - Civic-warm theme tokens; single-mascot architecture with pixel-aligned variant swaps (idle / typing / presenting / refusal); seated typing scene with 12-second behavior loop; welcome hero on empty thread; suggestion chips; speech-bubble assistant messages; page pinned (only chat thread + PDF viewer scroll); footer honesty line.
- Sidecar `/health` probe at session start; renders a `SystemHealthBanner` above the chat thread when the probe fails (e.g. sidecar not running). Returned inline from `startConversation` as `{conversationId, health}` — no event-subscription plumbing.
- **197 vitest passing**

## 2026-05-19 → 2026-05-20 hardening pass

Substantial reliability + UX work landed across this window. Each item ships as a feature branch merged with `--no-ff`; the merge commit is the entry point for the audit trail. All work in worktrees per CLAUDE.md convention, cleaned up after merge.

### Items 1-7 of the original dogfood-hardening plan (merge `1939347`, 2026-05-19/20)

| Item | What | Most-relevant file(s) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Per-session `.mcp.json` (alwaysLoad:true) + `.claude/settings.json` allow/deny (eliminates ToolSearch) | `web/lib/youcoded-session-provider.ts`, `web/lib/mcp-config-loader.ts` |
| 2 | `cite()` accepts `quote` (server derives offsets); `claim_span` relaxed 500→2000 with server soft-clamp | `mcp-server/src/tools/cite.ts`, `retrieval/api.py` `http_cite_validate` |
| 3 | `DEFAULT_PIPELINE_TOP_K` lowered 20→15 (measurement-gated by `scripts/measure_retrieve_size.py`) | `retrieval/pipeline.py` |
| 4 | `intent` parameter on `retrieve()` (lookup/compare/analyze → top_k 5/12/25); routes table in system prompt | `mcp-server/src/tools/retrieve.ts`, `retrieval/api.py` |
| 5 | Output-hygiene prompt rewrite — three banned leak categories + dogfood-test plan | `mcp-server/system-prompt.md`, `docs/superpowers/investigations/2026-05-20-prompt-rewrite-dogfood-tests.md` |
| 6 | Bridge JSONL logging + session-start `/health` probe + SystemHealthBanner | `mcp-server/src/lib/bridge-log.ts`, `web/components/SystemHealthBanner.tsx` |
| 7 | Sidecar `python-dotenv` auto-loads `.env.local` + startup preflight + README "Daily startup" checklist | `retrieval/api.py` `lifespan`, `README.md` |

Plan doc at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-budget-app-dogfood-hardening.md` (historical — captures the pre-execution design + open-question resolutions Q1/Q2/Q3).

### Follow-up fix waves (after Items 1-7 shipped)

Each wave responded to specific issues surfaced during dogfood verification of the previous wave.

**Wave A — Citation-extract patches (commits `5981dbb`, `4620ec3`).** Quote-only cite() calls were being silently dropped at the UI extraction layer because the extractor required numeric offsets. Patched to accept quote-only with a sentinel range; added FIFO-pair-fail→OK dedup for retries that rewrite claim_span entirely.

**Wave B — `cite-batch` branch (merge `3c6bf04`).** Dropped `_check_alignment` from `/cite/validate` (~40%→~5% false-rejection rate; removed the dominant retry-loop latency source). Added the `cite_batch` MCP tool + matching `/cite/validate_batch` sidecar endpoint with bulk DB fetch — collapses N serial cite round-trips into one for analyze-shaped answers. Web `citation-extract.ts` walks the batched input/output arrays; new `batchId` field disambiguates same-batch siblings from cross-block retries in the dedup pass.

**Wave C — `cite-resolved-offsets` branch (merge `2c570e6`).** Threads sidecar-derived `resolved_span_start` / `resolved_span_end` through the cite + cite_batch tool responses to the web UI, fixing the "Citation is on this page — exact text couldn't be pinpointed" badge cluster. Also denies `ToolSearch` in `.claude/settings.json` (alwaysLoad wasn't fully eliminating model-side ToolSearch habit), tightens the route classifier to default-to-Lookup for "Show me X" / "What is X" wording, lowers analyze top_k 25→18 to stay under Claude Code's spillover threshold.

**Wave D — `first-call-cap` branch (merge `af6a673`).** Progressive retrieval: first retrieve() of any session is capped to 5 chunks regardless of intent/top_k. Bypass via `deep_dive: true` for explicit thorough-coverage requests. After the first call, pass-through behavior. Route classifier rewritten to be about answer FORMAT, not retrieve sizing — breadth comes from iterative follow-up retrieves, not one-shot top_k.

**Wave E — `citation-accuracy` branch (merge `400d674`).** Three connected improvements to citation handling. (1) Per-sentence chip placement: `planCitationPlacements` walks every sentence and places a chip wherever the claim_span or the citation's key-fact token (largest currency / percentage) appears, with anti-duplicate guard. `CitationPlacement` gains an optional `column` field; `injectCiteSentinels` splices sentinels mid-line via right-to-left injection. Restated facts across multiple sentences now each get their own chip. (2) Strict-bbox PDF highlight: text-layer search extracted into a new `HighlightStrategy` interface (`web/lib/highlight-strategy.ts`) with `TextLayerSearchStrategy` as the default and a `CoordMapStrategy` placeholder for the #57 follow-up. When a chunk has a bbox, search is strictly bbox-restricted — no whole-page fallback. A miss surfaces "couldn't pinpoint" instead of a silent wrong highlight. (3) Always-visible `CitedTextPanel` below the PDF page renders the chunk's verbatim text with the cited span underlined — verify-by-eye surface for both happy and miss cases. Plus a sidecar-side change: `_validate_one_cite` now rejects quotes that appear multiple times in chunk.text, returning up to 3 positions in the error so the model picks a longer, unique quote on retry. Plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-20-citation-accuracy-and-per-sentence-chips.md`. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-citation-accuracy-and-per-sentence-chips-design.md`.

## What's open

### Modeling / behavior gaps
- **Model meta-narration leaks** ("Retrying the cites…", "All cites anchored", "Task tracking isn't relevant…") still appear in user-visible answer prose despite Task 12's Output-hygiene rewrite. The prompt-only fix isn't sufficient; needs another pass and possibly a mechanism-level intervention (e.g. stripping retry-narration text in the renderer before display).
- **Model occasionally writes verbose `claim_spans` that don't substring-match the rendered answer** — soft-fixed by the cite_batch + resolved-offsets work but not eliminated; chip attachment still fails when the model rewrites prose between cite() and final emission.

### PDF viewer accuracy (failure mode catalog — updated post-Wave E)
- **A. Source isn't a PDF (DOCX legislative bills).** UI still shows "Couldn't open source PDF" but the new always-visible `CitedTextPanel` below the viewer now shows the chunk's verbatim text with the cited span underlined, so the analyst can verify the cite even without a PDF viewer. #55's broader DOCX viewer is still a separate concern.
- **B. PDF exists, text-layer search fails to find the quote.** "Couldn't pinpoint" badge — same surface, but now the CitedTextPanel underneath shows the cited span in chunk text, so a miss is recoverable rather than dead-end. **Architectural fix still queued (#57):** capture chunk_text→PDF-coord mapping during ingest. Wave E added the `HighlightStrategy` interface so #57 can drop in as a `CoordMapStrategy` without rewriting `PdfPage`.
- **C. PDF exists, chunk's stored bbox is wrong** (MinerU mis-detection). Now produces an honest "couldn't pinpoint" badge instead of a silent wrong highlight, since Wave E removed the unrestricted-search fallback. Ingest QA still out of scope.
- **D. Citation references a chunk_id from a prior turn with no metadata** in the current turn's retrieve. `buildConversationResolvedChunkMap` exists for cross-turn fallback but is sometimes missing chunks. **Diagnosis queued (#56):** verify whether the cross-turn map is consulted, identify where the lookup fails.
- **E. Quote is ambiguous (appears multiple times in chunk.text).** Used to silently bind to the first occurrence → wrong-bbox highlight. Wave E rejects these at validate time so the model must pick a longer, unique quote.

### Not yet implemented (per the Phase 1c plan)
- **Faithfulness verifier (WS3).** Post-generation NLI-style check that strips claims whose cites don't actually back them. Core Invariant 2 says "citations are verified, not just emitted" — current enforcement is chunk_id + quote-in-chunk-text (catches invented chunks/quotes, not semantic faithfulness). The dropped `_check_alignment` was a string-overlap proxy, not real faithfulness. WS3 is the real fix.
- **Audit log writer (WS5).** No persistent record of `(retrieval_id, citation_id, claim_span, intent)` tuples for offline review. Schema-side hooks are in place — `retrieval_id` flows through retrieve() responses, `intent` echoes back, JSONL bridge log captures call-level data — but no DB writer.
- **Eval expansion (Phase 1b WS8).** Recall@K, citation-faithfulness rates, refusal precision. Unbuilt.
- **DOCX viewer (Phase 2).** Bills are DOCX; the Phase 2 plan adds an inline DOCX viewer. Until then, #55 (text-only fallback) is the stopgap.

### Volume ingest — current corpus
**382 documents / 7,755 chunks** as of 2026-05-12. Coverage:

| Publisher | FY 2025 | FY 2026 | FY 2027 |
|---|---|---|---|
| JLBC | Approps Report (111 per-agency) | Baseline (110 per-agency + 6 bd-pdf + 7 bh-pdf + 16 detailed-list + 2 topic) | Baseline (110 per-agency + 15 s-pdf + 2 topic) |
| Legislature | — | budget-bill | — |
| Governor | — | — | Executive Budget |
| AGAO | AFR (1) | — | — |

**Known gaps to fill** (none blocking but worth scoping):
- Older FYs entirely — FY24, FY23, FY22 baselines + approps reports + AFRs
- FY 2026 Approps Report (summarizes what actually passed in 2025 session)
- FY 2027 Approps Report / Budget bill (if/when it passes)
- Older Governor's Budgets (FY26, FY25)
- AGAO AFRs for FY24 and FY23

Hand-off prompt for additional ingest at [`PROMPT-volume-ingest.md`](PROMPT-volume-ingest.md).

### Open follow-up tasks (tracked in TaskList)
- **#45** — Investigate `(unknown)` tool card after Item 1 ships (verification-only; needs a fresh dogfood transcript)
- **#47** — BM25 query parser crashes on apostrophes (`Governor's`, `Children's`, etc. — ParadeDB parses `'` as a quote delimiter, whole retrieve() call aborts)
- **#55** — DOCX chunk fallback (render chunk text inline when no PDF backing)
- **#56** — Diagnose cross-turn metadata gap
- **#57** — Capture chunk→PDF coord map during ingest (architectural PDF-accuracy fix)
- **#58** — Post-mortem: 2026-05-20 dogfood revealed 4 distinct fix categories worth documenting

### Recently fixed — verify in next dogfood pass
- Restated facts across multiple sentences only chipped the first occurrence (per-sentence placement + key-fact-token rule)
- Wrong yellow rectangle when bbox-restricted search missed (strict-bbox, no whole-page fallback)
- Source text only visible inside the PDF (always-visible `CitedTextPanel` below the page)
- Quote-ambiguity silent wrong highlights (sidecar duplicate-quote rejection)
- Citation chips weren't rendering at all (citation-extract required offsets; now accepts quote-only)
- Failed retries weren't collapsing with their successful replacements (FIFO-pair-fail→OK dedup)
- 40% cite() false-rejection rate (dropped alignment heuristic)
- 60s+ tool round-trips on analyze-shaped answers (cite_batch single round-trip)
- "Couldn't pinpoint" PDF badges (resolved-offsets passthrough)
- ToolSearch round-trips at session start (added to deny list)
- "Show me X" classifying as Analyze and pulling 25 chunks (route-classifier defaults to Lookup; analyze lowered 25→18)
- First retrieve always pulling too many chunks regardless of question shape (progressive-retrieval first-call cap)

## Repo + portability

### Single git repo
Everything lives in `ask-the-budget-az-dev` →
`github.com/itsdestin/ask-the-budget-az-dev`. No multi-repo workspace,
no submodules.

### What's tracked vs not
- **Tracked:** all source, the MinerU manifests, the JLBC primer, agency/fund catalogs, raw DOCX user uploads (samples/raw-docx/), test fixtures
- **Gitignored:** `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `db/data/` (Postgres volume), `data/cached-pdfs/`, `data/extractor-output/`, `data/chunks/*` (except MANIFEST.md), `.env.local`, build outputs

### What must travel for a fresh device
1. **`.env.local`** — Voyage API key (paid; not in git)
2. **The Postgres data** — `db/data/` directory holds every chunk + embedding. Two paths:
   - **Fast:** copy `db/data/` from old machine, then `docker compose up -d`. Live in seconds.
   - **Slow:** re-run the ingest pipeline against PDFs. Costs Voyage API + several hours.

See [README.md → Moving to a new device](README.md#moving-to-a-new-device) for the exact commands.

### What's installed externally (NOT in the repo)
- Docker (or Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac)
- Node 20+ and npm
- Python 3.12 and `uv` (`pip install uv`)
- A running **YouCoded** or **Claude Code** instance — provides the LLM session via `ws://localhost:9900`

---

## Working conventions

- `setup.sh` — one-shot installer for everything regenerable. Run after `git clone`. Does NOT restore DB data.
- `bash setup.sh --verify` — runs all test suites (pytest + 2× vitest). Use before merging non-trivial work.
- All three services run in separate processes; `npm` is in `mcp-server/` and `web/`; `uv` drives Python.
- README's "Daily startup" section is the canonical reference for the launch order: Docker → Postgres → sidecar → YouCoded → web UI.
